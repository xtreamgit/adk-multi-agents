User uploaded image 1
Based on the current tool set, the 3 tools that would work together to perform the invoice monitoring action are:

1. get_corpus_info
Purpose: Monitor the invoices corpus to detect new documents
Usage: Periodically check the corpus to see what invoices have been added, get metadata about documents including count, size, and file details
2. rag_query
Purpose: Extract specific information from invoices
Usage: Query individual invoices to retrieve payment terms, amounts, vendor information, and other relevant data fields that need to be checked against alert conditions
3. retrieve_document
Purpose: Access full invoice details for comprehensive analysis
Usage: Retrieve complete invoice documents to parse structured data (payment terms, amounts, dates) and perform detailed validation
Important Note:
The current tool set does not include alert/notification functionality. To fully implement the invoice monitoring scenario, you would need to add additional capabilities:

Scheduling mechanism - To periodically check the corpus for new invoices
Alert/notification tool - To send alerts via email, Slack, or other channels
Business logic layer - To evaluate conditions (e.g., payment terms > 90 days, amount > threshold)
The existing tools provide the data retrieval capabilities, but the monitoring, condition checking, and alerting would require new tools or enhancement of the agent's instruction logic to trigger actions based on query results.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS
 
Metformin for Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Adults with Prediabetes: 
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
 
ABSTRACT
Background: Prediabetes affects 96 million US adults. Metformin has been 
proposed for diabetes prevention, but evidence requires systematic evaluation.
 
Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Embase through December 2025. 
Included RCTs comparing metformin to placebo/standard care in prediabetic adults. 
Primary outcome: progression to Type 2 diabetes. Meta-analysis used random-effects 
models. Quality assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.
 
Results: 15 RCTs included (N=18,467, mean age 52, 58% female, BMI 32). 
Metformin reduced diabetes incidence by 31% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.76, p<0.001, 
I²=45%). NNT=14 over 3 years. Greater benefit in BMI>35 (RR 0.60). Quality: MODERATE. 
GI side effects in 28% (mild, transient).
 
Conclusions: MODERATE-quality evidence supports metformin for diabetes prevention 
in prediabetes, particularly with BMI>35. Clinicians should discuss benefits/risks.
 
[PRISMA Diagram showing 856 identified → 23 full-text → 15 included]
[Forest Plot showing individual studies and pooled estimate]
[GRADE Evidence Profile Table]
 
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Consider metformin 850-1500mg daily for prediabetic patients, especially BMI>35
- Counsel on GI side effects, typically resolve within weeks
- Continue lifestyle interventions alongside pharmacotherapy
- Monitor for diabetes conversion annually
Output: Rigorous, evidence-based systematic review enabling clinicians to make informed treatment decisions, supporting guideline development, and identifying research gaps—all compiled efficiently from multiple research papers with transparent methodology and reproducible results.
